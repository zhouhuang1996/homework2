Yes,life is a journey.One that is much better traveled with a companion by our side,Of course that companion can be just about anyone,a neighbor on the other side of the street Or the man on the other side of the bed.
The companion can be a mother with good intentions Or a child who is up to no good.Still despite our best intentions,Some of us will lose our companion along the way.And then the journey becomes unbearable.You see,human beings are designed for many things.But loneliness isn¡¯t one of them
